 *At the cabin, 23th of Frostfall 06:30.*

The party wakes up and prepares to leave for Suzal, leaving Sam asleep with Heskeni to watch over him. Adaly gives the halfling a rope and tells her to prevent Sam from coming after them, by restraining him if necessary, but also to keep him safe.

Jeremy gives the party the stabilization gem for the leviathan's portal, which he had picked up from the jeweler in Suzal. He also tells the party that he got word from his contact in Witterheim that the population of Timbre has become strangely reluctant to talk to strangers. 

Adaly and Amara decide to go to Suzal ahead of Livia and Jeremy because Adaly would like to make a stop at old smudge to buy some more potions to resist the mental effects of being in the presence of a leviathan. 

During the walk, Adaly asks Amara what she thinks of Adaly using her blood while she was in Uladrems domain. Amara replies that she is perfectly okay with it and that such a situation was, in fact, exactly why she had allowed Adaly to take some of her blood. 

Adaly then informs Amara that Es-Vahelieth is planning some kind of teleportation ritual and suggests that it might be safer for Amara to keep the bag of holding on her in case the devil comes after Adaly again. 

The two arrive in Suzal and immediately go to visit Smudge. The elderly tiefling is brewing something for another customer, but agrees to have 6 more doses of the potion ready for Adaly on the 27th. Amara makes use of the opportunity to buy three doses of Cinderpetal Extract and five doses of Bloodbark Sap.

After leaving Smudge, Adaly and Amara reunite with Jeremy and Livia and teleport to Ingry. As they walk out of the teleportation hall, they notice a man gesturing for Adaly to come over. Adaly turns invisible and approaches the man, who claims to have a message that is best discussed in private. 

Adaly follows the man into a warehouse, where he reveals that he was send by countess Kale, the mother of Josenno and Jasmin. He then tosses a vial on the floor that explodes in a burst of colors that stick to Adaly, revealing her position. Two of his companions immediately start attacking Adaly, who turns to retreat back out onto the street. 

Outside, Amara and Livia make short work of the other thugs that accompanied the man while Adaly casts darkness on the area. As her ambusher stumbles outside, Adaly stabs him and takes a sample of his blood before allowing him to retreat.

Amara kills another of the thugs by pummeling him into the wall. The last of the thugs attempts to follow after his fleeing employer, but Amara easily catches up to and kills the man as he tries to get away.

Wary of how the situation will look to any city guards that might come across it, the party drags the bodies of the thugs inside and Adaly casts Devil's Eyes. She unfortunately isn't able to spy on the man that just got away, but she does manage to spy on Josenno having a conversation with Jasmin. They talk about their mother having arrived in the city and Jasmin expresses an intense dislike for the woman. The two are interrupted by a knock on the door and Adaly watches a large group of young noblemen and women enter the room before the vision ends.

The party leaves the corpses in the warehouse and starts walking to the headquarters of the order  of the Hallowed Path. On their way, Amara notices a strange black bird whose beak opens horizontally instead of vertically. Unfortunately, the bird flies away before the party can get a good look at it.

At their destination, Adaly asks the paladin guard, Fred, to keep an eye out for strange black birds before going inside, where Damon tells the party that the meeting with the military is after lunch at the palace. Adaly shows the new recruits that she saw through Josenno's eyes to the same female paladin that helped them identify Josenno and the others before.

The party then decides to find a bathhouse to clean up before going to the palace. In the bathhouse, Adaly and Amara once more question Livia about her secret and once more she refuses to answer, revealing that the shaman thinks it's unlikely that they will be able to figure out what is going on even with soul sight. 

The party pushes a bit further, though, and Livia reveals that she is no demon or devil, but refuses to comment on whether she is mortal or not. She then questions Amara about her hellmark, but Amara refuses to answer, telling her that she will explain what the nine-pointed star is about if Livia reveals her secret. Livia refuses.

After the bathhouse, the party proceeds to the meeting at the palace. Here, they meet Ansel Redheart, Oliver Wildegarde, Nicolas Chevalier and the scribes they have brought to the meeting. Adaly explains the situation and tries to convince the group to take action against the warlocks, but gets interrupted when King Rubinion walks into the meeting. 

The king does not believe the party's story, having personally seen duke Avario two weeks ago. To add credibility to their story, Adaly casts Devil's Eyes and relays what she sees to the group using Minor Illusion. She shows Josenno talking to a demon, instructing it to pick off individuals or small groups of people that come nearby, but go back to the mansion to inform him if it encounters larger groups or if Adaly or Amara show up.

The display still doesn't convince the king and he insist on just going to the manor to sort things out with the duke himself. Eventually, everyone agrees that a group of guards along with Adaly, Amara, Damon and three of the paladins of the Hallowed Path will accompany the king. 

A handful of guards and the paladins will travel ahead of the group, pretending to be on a regular patrol, while Adaly, Amara, the king and Damon will be invisible and travel alongside the remaining guards, who are disguised as a merchant caravan. Damon also receives Adaly's Nightwalker Ioun Stone so he can detect their heartbeats.

This decided, everyone goes off to make their preparations and Adaly and Amara go on a walk through the city, trying to find more of the strange black birds. Amara eventually manages to get a good glimpse of a few of them by climbing on the roof of a building, but they are unfortunately too far away to get to them. 

They then join the group that is assembled at the north gate of the city and set off to the manor. Before they can reach the gates of the estate, though, thick mists rise up from the ground and Damon remarks that Amara's heartbeat disappeared. Before the group can figure out what is going on, they hear screams coming from the group of guards ahead of them. 

Damon and the king retreat while Adaly and Amara charge deeper into the mist. They arrive to find the the guards and paladins engaged in a fight with a group of the demonic mist creatures Adaly saw through Josenno's eyes. 

The fight isn't going well, visibility is extremely limited and the mist fiends are capable of teleporting around the mists, making it hard to figure out where the next attack is coming.

With her ability to detect heartbeats, Amara leads Adaly and one of the paladins, named Jack, to one of the mist fiends. They quickly get surrounded by the other mist fiends, but still manage to kill one of the creatures. Adaly calls the retreat as Amara severs the head of the mist fiend to take back as evidence.

Unfortunately, as they retreat, one of the mist fiends attacks and kills Jack, but all the other guards and paladins, as well as Adaly and Amara, manage to get away and rejoin the rest of the group.

Back at the palace, Amara unceremoniously dumps the head of the mistfiend on the table. Now convinced of the existence of a threat, the king, margrave, general and the captains of the city watch and the paladin order decide on a course of action.

Patrols will be discreetly stationed around Avario manor until an attack on the manor is prepared. Damon asks if the party will help them in the attack, but Adaly notes that their agenda is pretty full at the moment. The king incredulously asks what they could possibly have planned that is more important than a devil taking up residence in the manor of one of the most important noblemen in the kingdom and convincing the children of the nobility to become warlocks. Adaly responds that there is another devil they are hunting who is still personally on the prime material and therefor a bigger problem. 

Since it will take some time to prepare the strike anyway, Adaly notes that the party will likely be available on the 35th (12 days from now) while Amara asks if there might be payment of some sort involved. The king somewhat begrudgingly agrees. 

For now, the names of the noble children involved with Es-Grenalieth will be kept secret to prevent backlash from their parents and other family members.

After the meeting, the party goes to a tavern where Adaly once more casts Devil's eyes. She watches through Es-Vahelieth's eyes as the devil starts a ritual. Meanwhile, Amara notices one of the strange black birds outside the window shortly before another one of the birds flies into the tavern.

At that moment, every light source in the room dims at once and Es-Vahelieth's voice booms through the space. Amara immediately gets up, grabs Adaly and stuffs her into the bag of holding. The party then makes a run for the exit while Amara flings her mug at the bird, splattering it in mid-air. 

Just after the party makes it through the door, the front wall of the building explodes as the temple that Es-Vahelieth was using as a base materializes around them, including the devil himself and a group of his minions. 

The hounds and demons Es-Vahelieth brought with attack Livia and Jeremy while Amara uses one of the altars to leap up to the platform where Es-Vahelieth is standing and begins to attack. Es-Vahelieth telekinetically pulls the bag of holding from Amara and turns it inside out, spewing its the content, including Adaly, across the temple floor.
